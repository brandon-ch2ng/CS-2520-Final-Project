This project analyzes biking data from the city of Chicago to uncover patterns and trends that distinguish members from non-members in the bike-sharing system. By exploring user behavior, we developed visualizations that compare time-based and locational trends, such as peak usage hours, seasonal patterns, and popular start/end stations. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of how members and non-members utilize the service differently, enabling more targeted marketing and operational strategies.

In addition to visual analysis, we built a logistic regression model to identify the factors influencing membership status. The model highlighted significant predictors such as trip duration, time of use, and station location, offering valuable insights into user behavior. Using these findings, we proposed actionable strategies to improve membership rates, including personalized membership plans, optimized station placements, and time-based promotions tailored to specific user groups. This data-driven approach aims to enhance engagement and optimize the bike-sharing system for diverse user needs.
